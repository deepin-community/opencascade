  * Improved package short descriptions.

  * Add debian/patches/fix-ftgl-includes.patch: upstream supports an
    old version of ftgl, sources must be patched to work with a

  * Add debian/patches/submitted/move-osd_fontmgr-vis.patch: move
    OSD_FontMgr from TKernel into TKOpenGl so that libTKernel
    is not linked against X11.
  * Add debian/patches/submitted/enable-freeimage.patch: fix
    compilation against recent freeimageplus.  For now the configure
    script is called without --with-freeimage though, this pulls in
    too many dependencies.
  * Add debian/patches/submitted/add-enable-openmp.patch: add a
    new configure option --enable-openmp to parallelize loops with
    openmp instead of tbb.
  * Add debian/patches/compatibility-occ630-Value.patch: several
    classes break compatibility with 6.3.0 by renaming exported
    methods.  This patch creates aliases to help Debian packages
    being ported to opencascade 6.5.0, but it will be removed
    as soon as those applications are fixed, we do not want to
    diverge from upstream.
  * Add debian/patches/submitted/workaround-bug-mesher.patch: the
    new mesher in OCC 6.5.0 is more robust, but also produces much
    larger meshes on B-spline surfaces.  Until this bug is fixed, it
    seems better to not use the specific B-spline mesher, but the
    generic one.  Patch provided by Jérôme Robert.
  * Add debian/patches/debian/patches/configure-cflags.patch:
    compile C sources with -D_GNU_SOURCE as with C++.  This is mostly
    cosmetics, but allows installing libraries on a very old system
    (glibc 2.2.5 against 2.7 without this flag), because C source
    files in ros/src/IGESFile use sscanf, which adds a dependency
    against glibc >= 2.7 unless compiled with -D_GNU_SOURCE.
  * Add debian/patches/submitted/fix-display-text.patch: text doesn't
    get displayed in 6.5, patch provided by Venugopal Gudimetla on
    the opencascade forum.
  * Add debian/patches/hurd-fixes.patch: this patch will gather
    fixes needed to build on Hurd.  In this hunk, drop method
    OSD_Process::CurrentDirectory(), it is unused but cause FTBFS.
  * Slightly modify fix-asm.patch to use upstream assembly code on
    x86 and amd64, and atomic extensions provided by GNU g++ on
    other architectures.  Disable them on sparcv9, they currently
    cause a FTBFS.
  * Move some header files between libopencascade-ocaf-lite-dev and
    libopencascade-ocaf-dev to be more consistent with upstream
    modules.  Breaks/Replaces are added in debian/control to

  [Denis Barbier]

opencascade (6.3.0.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Denis Barbier]
  * New Upstream Version.  (closes: #501128)
  * Upstream replaced Triangle by a free implementation,
    thus external-triangle.patch is removed as well as
    dependencies against libtriangle-dev.
  * Remove ros/src/FontMFT/*.mft files, these font files
    have no sources.  (As a side effect, closes: #487116)
  * All non-free bits have thus been removed, and opencascade
    is moved from non-free into main.
  * Jason Kraftcheck's patches have been applied upstream,
    occ6.2.patch and correct-libs.patch are dropped.
  * Split packages as suggested by Jason Kraftcheck in
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-science/2008/01/msg00023.html
    + opencascade-tools is split into opencascade-draw
      and opencascade-wok
    + libopencascade6.3.0 is split into
      libopencascade-foundation-6.3.0, libopencascade-modeling-6.3.0,
      libopencascade-ocaf-lite-6.3.0, libopencascade-ocaf-6.3.0 and
      libopencascade-visualization-6.3.0.
    + Ditto for -dev packages.
  * New upstream build system now installs everything with
    'make install', but DESTDIR support was missing and
    requires a new destdir.patch patch.
  * Call configure from a new directory to ease cleaning up.
  * New wok-install.patch to move WOK files into
    /usr/share/tcltk/wok2.0/
  * Add --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-maintainer-mode
    to configure flags to speed up compilation and avoid
    running autotools
  * New tkernel-ld.patch patch to add -ldl to libTKernel
    which uses dlopen.  This flag was previously set by
    accident because ros/configure.in did set LIBS=$TCL_LIBS.
  * New occ6.3.0.patch patch to fix C++ configure tests and
    drop #ifdef from installed headers, they must not rely
    on config.h providing the expected symbols.
  * New dep-libs.patch to fix inter-library dependencies.
  * New make-wok-libs-private.patch to move private WOK
    libraries into /usr/lib/opencas, and remove library versions.
  * New make-draw-libs-private.patch to move private DRAW
    libraries into /usr/lib/opencas, and remove library versions.
    Add rpath information into DRAWEXE to find plug-ins.
  * New wokunix-fdescr.patch patch to fix build failure when
    compiling with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2.  Patch written by
    Andrea Florio for openSUSE.
  * New wokstep_extract.patch patch to fix WOK, garbage was written
    into generated files.  (closes: #501352)
  * debian/rules: Replace obsolete dh_movefiles by dh_install.
  * Copy ros/adm/UDLIST from Windows binary tarball, the one
    shipped with sources is outdated.  This is useful to
    compile binaries with WOK.
  * Add Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git fields in debian/control.
  * Build-depends on default-jdk-builddep to enable java wrapper.
  * Modify CreateFactory.tcl to only define CreateFactory function,
    this script can then be used by other scripts.

  [Adam Powell]
  * Closing old bugs fixed in previous unreleased versions (closes: #491912,
    #494715).
  * Changed Maintainer to debian-science and added myself as the first
    uploader (closes: #496668).
