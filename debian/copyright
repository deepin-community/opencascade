Comment:
 This is based on OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT).
 .
 OCCT 6.7.0 (released on December 2013) has been relicensed to LGPL 2.1,
 with an exception clause to allow embedding header files in derived work.
 .
 There are some files which are marked with "The original implementation
 Copyright: (C) RINA S.p.A", so we approached upstream asking for clarification
 about the relicensing and we've received this answer from our upstream contact

 Regarding the files holding RINA copyrights, they have been incorporated
 according to the license agreement with RINA S.p.A, dated 2006-05-10.  The
 license itself is defined as follows:
 .
 RINA grants to OCC a free, worldwide and transferable license to :
 - reproduce or to have all or part of the Components listed in article 3
   reproduced as well as all updates as mentioned hereinafter on any medium, in
   particular, paper, magnetic, digital, IT, electronic, CD-ROM, CD-DVD or any
   other current or future, known or unknown medium, and this, without any
   limitation as to number,
 - adapt or to have all or part of the Components adapted, the right to correct,
   have developed, carry out or have Derivative Works carried out, maintain,
   decompile, mix, modify, assemble, arrange, digitalise, put onto any
   configuration, interface, any software, database, IT product, to use the
   algorithms for any purpose and transcribe fully or partly, in any form, to
   integrate all or part with or into existing or future works, and this on any
   medium,
 - translate or have translated all or part of the Components into any language
   or any programming language, and this on any medium.
 .
 OCC undertakes to integrate said Components (modified or not) as open source
 (e.g. by including them preferably into Open CASCADE or, being this impossible,
 secondarily into SALOME) as condition for having the right to use them for the
 benefit of OCC's customers in some other projects than LH3D-3H.  ...
